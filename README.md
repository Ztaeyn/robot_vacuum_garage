# Robot Vacuum Garage door

ESP+Nema17 Stepper controlled.


Hardware based on: 
* https://hackaday.io/project/178993-space-saving-robot-vacuum-cleaner-garage, where I've added open and close limit switches.

5 minutes after I finally made my own simple code, which runs the motor a set amount of steps, I found this great inspiration from 
*https://github.com/NeilDuToit92/ESPHome_Garage/blob/master/ESPHome.yml


#TODO
- Add hardware shopping list
- Improve the schematic.
- Replace the protoboard with a "proper" PCB.
- Install it all.
